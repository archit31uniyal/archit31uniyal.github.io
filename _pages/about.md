I am a computer science master's student at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, USA, graduating in December 2024.

My current interests include large language models, privacy in machine learning models and differential privacy. I am open to collaborations, so feel free to email me if you have a cool idea and want to discuss it.

Currently, I am actively looking for full-time positions in data science and machine learning.
